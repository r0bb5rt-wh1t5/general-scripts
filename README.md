# General scripts

This repository contains scripts that I have written for YouTube videos. They are not big enough to be a
separate repository, but they were fun to write and I learned something new while writing them.

## List of scripts

- **http-file-transfers** - [Uploading an Image to a Server Without Using Any Libraries]()

- **alexbers-com-sql** - [How to Complete All Levels of the SQL Injection Challenge on alexbers.com]()

- **zixem-altervista-org** - [How to Complete All Zixem Challenges | Part 1 «SQLi»]()

- **punched-card**

- **conway-game-of-life**
